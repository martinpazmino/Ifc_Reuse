# Docker Image Usage

A pre-built Docker image for the IFC Reuse application is available on Docker Hub. This image contains all required dependencies so you can run the platform without building it locally.

To download the latest image run:

```bash
docker pull martinpazmino1/ifc_reuse_app:latest
```

After pulling the image you can start the container using `docker run` or the provided `docker-compose.yml` file.
